## Overview
This project focuses on optimizing Support Vector Machine (SVM) parameters using Bayesian Optimization on the [Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/468/online+shoppers+purchasing+intention+dataset) (UCI ML Repository ID: 468). The objective is to enhance multi-class classification performance through iterative hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

## Dataset Description
The Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset contains anonymized session-level data from an e-commerce website. It is designed to predict whether a user will complete a purchase based on their browsing behavior and session attributes.
- Features: 17
- Total Instances: 12,330
